# GaitAnalysis_BM
Evaluation of balance from kinematics data of human gait  
## Overview
Matlab code for analyzing gait kinematics data with balance map which evaluate walking balance.

## Dependency
The code were built in matlab 2019a.

## Setup
Please download and extract zip file. Run "main.m", then kinematics data in "gait_sample.csv" are processed.
Animation of the trajecectory on balance map and a stick picture will be presented.
